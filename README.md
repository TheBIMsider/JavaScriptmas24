A place to store my solution attempts for the [Scrimba 2024 JavaScriptmas Challenge](https://scrimba.com/javascriptmas)

**What is JavaScriptmas?**   
JavaScriptmas is an "advent calendar" of festive daily code challenges, designed to help you level up your JS and CSS skills and have lots of festive fun at the same time! ‚òÉÔ∏è

**AI to the Rescue!**  
I love doing these challenges, but I never seem to have enough time to keep my HTML, CSS, and JS skills up to scratch. So this year, I'm enlisting the help of AI to speed up my learning for both coding with HTML, CSS & JS, as well as working with AI for coding. It's not always right, so my review skills are going to improve too. üòâ I'll try to include the AI(s) I used for each day.

**Challenges**   
Day 1: Grandpa's Gift List (coming soon I started a day late)
Day 2: [Ugly Advent Calendar](https://thebimsider.github.io/JavaScriptmas24/Day2)  (Claude)
